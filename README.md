# Kindred

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthewferderber/Kindred.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthewferderber/Kindred)

**Kindred is a League of Legends API client written in Elixir.**

**Documentation available at: <http://hexdocs.pm/kindred>**

**Still being worked on heavily, things will probably change as the rest of the api is implemented**

###Working Features

Currently only the following endpoints are added:

* Champion Mastery
* Champion
* Summoner
* Game

##Usage
    client = Kindred.Client.new("na", System.get_env("LEAGUE_API_KEY"), 10)
    Kindred.new(client)
    response = Kindred.Summoner.get_by_name("Ferdora")
    IO.inspect response
    # {:ok, %{"ferdora" => %{"id" => 27754362, "name" => "Ferdora", "profileIconId" => 599,
    # "revisionDate" => 1454047682000, "summonerLevel" => 30}}}


## Installation
